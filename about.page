This extension enables the author filter feature by using the pageâ€™s author property to add multiple routes, such as
`http://127.0.0.1/blog/author/:author/1`, to each page to allow users to list all pages in the current folder by author.

### Usage

These HTML classes will be added to the root element if it contains a `class` attribute when you are on the authors
page. You can use this feature to to create a specific look or response on your site from the client side if the
following classes are found in the root element:

`is:authors`
: Will be added if the current items view is an authors view and is not empty.

Example usage in CSS code:

~~~ .css
.is\:authors body {
  border-top: 4px solid #f00;
}
~~~

Example usage in JS code:

~~~ .js
if (document.documentElement.classList.contains('is:authors')) {
    console.info('You are currently in the authors page.');
}
~~~

These additional conditional statements are available for use in layouts to show/hide elements on your site from the
server side:

`$site->is('authors')`
: Returns `true` if current items view is an authors view and is not empty.

Example usage in HTML/PHP code:

~~~ .html.php
<?php if ($site->is('authors')): ?>
  <p role="alert">
    <?= i('You are currently in the authors page.'); ?>
  </p>
<?php endif; ?>
~~~

These additional variables are available for use in layouts that carry data related to the currently active author page:

`$author`
: This variable is an instance of the `User` class, which you can use to get the author information.

Example usage in HTML/PHP code:

~~~ .html.php
<?php if ($site->is('authors') && !empty($author)): ?>
  <p role="alert">
    <?= i('Showing list of articles written by %s.', (string) $author); ?>
  </p>
<?php endif; ?>
